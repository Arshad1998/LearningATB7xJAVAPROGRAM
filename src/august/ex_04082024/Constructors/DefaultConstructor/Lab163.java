        /*  Default Constructor

              Statements inside them will be automatically called and executed when the object is created
              Only one default constructor can be created for a class
              No return type

           Now lets see the syntax of object creation again
           Person p1 =new Person();
            Person ->  CLass loader will initiate the class person
            new -> This will create a object in Heap area
            Person() - This is the Default constructor(Special method) which is automatically called during this statement
            p1 - will be the reference

          */

    }
}
